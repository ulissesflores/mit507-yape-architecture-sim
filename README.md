> **State-of-the-Art architectural validation for high-frequency FinTech systems.**

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains the scientific artifacts supporting the case study **"Yape: From Monolith to Cell-Based Architecture"**. 

Developed by **Carlos Ulisses Flores** for the MIT-507 (Digital Organization) course, this project uses Discrete Event Simulation (DES) to mathematically prove why legacy banking architectures fail under "Black Friday" loads and how **Cell-Based Architectures (Bulkheads)** provide infinite horizontal scalability.

## 🧪 The Experiment

We simulate two distinct architectural patterns under stress conditions (500 TPS):

1.  **AS-IS (Monolithic/Legacy):** A system with a shared `PostgreSQL` resource. Validates the "Hollow Core" problem where database locks cause cascading latency.
2.  **TO-BE (Cell-Based/Event-Driven):** A system sharded into 10 independent `Cells`, using `Kafka` for asynchronous ingestion. Validates **Little's Law** ($L = \lambda W$) applied to throughput.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A: Cloud (Google Colab)
Click the **"Open in Colab"** badge above to run the simulation in your browser without installation.

### Option B: Local Execution
```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone [https://github.com/ulissesflores/mit507-yape-architecture-sim.git](https://github.com/ulissesflores/mit507-yape-architecture-sim.git)
cd mit507-yape-architecture-sim

# 2. Install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run
python src/simulation.py
```

### 📊 Results & Hypothesis

The simulation demonstrates that under high load ($\lambda > \mu$):

* **Monolith:** Latency grows exponentially as queue size increases (blocking I/O).
* **Cell-Based:** Latency remains constant for the user (async ACK), while backend throughput scales linearly with the number of cells.
